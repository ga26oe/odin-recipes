    <ul>
        <li>
            5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
        </li>

        <li>
            4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
        </li>

        <li>
            salt and freshly ground black pepper
        </li>

        <li>
            1 ½ cups halved cherry tomatoes
        </li>
        1 bunch green onions, cut into ½-inch slices
        <li>
            ½ cup chicken broth
        </li>
        2 tablespoons coarse-grained mustard
        <li>
            1 ½ sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
        </li>
        ½ bunch fresh thyme, chopped
        <li>
        2 cups shredded Gruyère cheese
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour 3 tablespoons olive oil into a shallow platter and lay chicken breasts on top. Rub with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken breasts until browned, about 4 minutes per side.
        </li>

        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Place tomatoes and green onions in the baking dish and pour chicken broth on top.
        </li>
            Combine mustard, rosemary, and thyme in a small bowl and brush onto chicken breasts. Place chicken breasts on top of the vegetables in the baking dish. Cover with Gruyère cheese.
        <li>
        </li>
            Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
